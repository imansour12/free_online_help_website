# free_online_help_website
This open source website is supposed to give people under the age of eighteen a platform where they can seek help regarding their emotional issues.

Not much work is being done, but in the upcoming days, there should be a functional chat app built in wih protection against spam bots. The realtime database used is Google Firebase.

Most of the code is written in react native.

Enjoy :D
